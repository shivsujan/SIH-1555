Description: Participants are tasked with developing a Virtual Herbal Garden that is engaging, informative, and user-friendly. This virtual garden should include: Interactive 3D Models: Realistic 3D models of medicinal plants that users can rotate, zoom, and explore from different angles. Detailed Information: Comprehensive details about each plant, including its botanical name, common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and methods of cultivation. Multimedia Integration: High-quality images, videos, and audio descriptions to enhance the learning experience. Search and Filter Options: Advanced search functionality to easily locate specific plants and filter them based on various criteria like medicinal uses, region, and type. Virtual Tours: Guided virtual tours highlighting specific themes, such as plants for digestive health, immunity, skin care, etc. User Interaction: Features that allow users to bookmark favourite plants, take notes, and share information on social media. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a comprehensive Virtual Herbal Garden that serves as a valuable educational tool for students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector. This platform should make the knowledge of medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, promoting awareness and understanding of traditional herbal practices. It should be visually appealing, informative, and interactive, providing users with an immersive experience that combines technology with traditional knowledge.

## Idea
Sanjeevani 3D – A Digital Revival of Nature’s Healing Touch

 Sanjeevani 3D is an immersive Virtual Herbal Garden platform that blends the traditional healing legacy of AYUSH with modern 3D technology. It allows users to explore medicinal plants in 3D, learn about their uses, habitat, and cultivation, and even experience guided virtual healing tours — all from the comfort of their homes.

Idea:
Create a virtual herbal ecosystem where users can:

See, feel, and learn about medicinal plants through lifelike 3D models 

Understand the therapeutic value of each herb via visual and audio storytelling

Take thematic virtual tours based on health concerns (e.g., immunity, skin, digestion)

Interact, bookmark, take notes, and spread awareness via social platforms 


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

Sanjeevani 3D is not just a platform; it is a living, breathing digital sanctuary where the timeless wisdom of ancient herbal medicine intertwines seamlessly with the marvels of modern 3D technology. It invites users to step beyond mere information and embark on a multisensory journey — touching, seeing, hearing, and discovering the secrets held by each medicinal plant.

At its core, Sanjeevani 3D offers a rich, immersive experience: lifelike 3D models of herbal plants, rendered with meticulous attention to detail — from the delicate veins on a leaf to the vibrant hues of a flower’s bloom. These models are complemented by interactive storytelling, where every plant reveals its story through engaging audio-visual narratives. Users learn about the plant’s therapeutic properties, traditional uses, ideal growing conditions, and cultural significance — all wrapped in beautifully narrated tales that stir curiosity and respect for nature’s pharmacy.

The platform is more than exploration; it is a guided companion for healing. Tailored virtual tours focus on specific health themes such as immunity enhancement, skin care rituals, digestive wellness, and mental calmness. These thematic paths allow users to immerse themselves in curated herbal journeys, discovering the right plants and remedies aligned with their personal wellness goals.

Engagement thrives through interactive features — users can bookmark favorite plants, jot down personalized notes, and share their discoveries with friends or herbalist communities, fostering a growing, supportive ecosystem of knowledge and care.

Behind this enchanting experience is a robust technological backbone: a dynamic backend architecture that supports seamless user profile management, real-time analytics of user engagement, and continuous content updates. The vast multimedia library — including 3D assets, videos, and soundscapes — is delivered swiftly via cloud storage and content delivery networks, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted exploration across devices.

Ultimately, Sanjeevani 3D is a digital revival — a heartfelt tribute to AYUSH’s ancient healing traditions, reborn in a form accessible to the modern seeker. It bridges centuries of knowledge with tomorrow’s technology, making herbal wisdom not just a relic of the past, but a vibrant, living guide to health and harmony in today’s world.
